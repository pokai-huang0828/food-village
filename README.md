# Food Village

## Project Overview
We chose to to develop Food Village to solve two problems that we saw:
 - Restaurants throwing out excess food at the end of the night 
 - People not being able to afford to eat 

This application allows restaurants to post that they have extra food and allows users to collect food from the restaurants listed on our application. 

### Features for Restaurants
-	Food providers can set details about the food they would like to offer (date, time, quantity, pick-up location and full description of food items)
-	Food providers can add images to their posts
-	Food providers will have a profile to inform users of who they are and what their business looks like 

### Features for Users
- The app will display a list of food providers who have active offers for food, images of the food items, a brief description of what is being given away as well as available time and the location of the pick-up location
- Users can click on a post to read more about the food item before they claim it 
- A map will show right on the food post so that users will be able to find the restaurant
